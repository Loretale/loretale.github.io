1. Powergaming and metagaming are not permitted. *Metagaming means to use information in character where you only know it out of character, but your character has not actually learned the information. Powergaming refers to making your character more powerful than they actually are. In general, remember you are writing stories together with other people, and this is not a game you should be trying to win.*
2. Any mechanical action may be considered a roleplay action, and may therefore have consequences in character.
3. Roleplay MUST happen on platform. This means on the server. For example, roleplay done in discord private messages is not considered canon.
4. No explicit roleplay on the server or related platforms. Roleplay with characters who are minors off-server will be met with a permanent ban with no appeal.
5. Characters, groups, nations, religions, or other (roleplay) institutions should not closely mimic present or past real life institutions, nor should they closely mimic concepts from existing media. *E.g., it is not permitted to create a character called "Bilbo Baggins".*
6. All characters played by people must be at least 15 years old.
7. Out of character (OOC) posts in roleplay channels or roleplay forum discussions are not allowed.
8. Low effort roleplay and/or meme roleplay may be subject to moderation action.
9. All roleplayed actions must strictly adhere to server lore. Player submitted lore may be taken under consideration, but should not be used until it is officially sanctioned. If you wish to write a piece of lore, please make a ticket first and discuss it with the staff.
10. The ability to use magic can be assigned to characters by other characters, who have the ability to do so. Characters without the ability to use a certain magic, who have not been taught, should not use the magic.
11. Technology is locked to a medieval fantasy aesthetic. This means there are no guns or cannons.
12. Combat goes by defender default; The defender has a choice between roleplay combat or mechanical PvP. If there is no agreement, combat roleplay wins by default.
13. In combat situations with 5 or more people, mechanical combat should be use if any party involved wishes to do so.
14. Strictly no metagaming to join combat situations. *While metagaming is not allowed in general, using it to join combat situations will be met with heavier sanctions.*
15. Parties may use alternative combat systems at their own discretion.
16. Player outfit (skin, cosmetics) should be in character and appropriate to the medieval fantasy aesthetic of the server.
