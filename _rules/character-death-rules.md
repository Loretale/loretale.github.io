> *Note these mechanics are pending implementation.*

1. Every character starts out with 3 lives. These will be kept track of by the server.
2. When a character dies, they lose one of these lives. When they lose all three lives, they are permanently dead.
3. Mechanical deaths not in combat with another player do not count towards loss of lives.
4. In character suicide always counts towards the loss of a life.
5. When a character loses a life, their entire inventory should be dropped.
6. Characters gain an extra life every month, up to a maximum of 3 lives.
