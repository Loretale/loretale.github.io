        <h3>Storytelling</h3>
        <p>
          Storytelling is key to the community, with the primary aim of the platform and server being collaborative
          storytelling through roleplay. All platforms, mods, plugins, and rules should be made to enable this goal.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
          Collaboration is important to keep a healthy community. This means listening to community feedback, and
          allowing the community to have a say in the development of the story, lore, and mods for the server, such as
          through
          <a href="https://github.com/Loretale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. It also means that
          out of character collaboration and communication between players is encouraged: if you want to hit certain
          story points for your character, feel free to ask and communicate with other players what you would like to
          happen and see if anyone can enable in this. On a larger scale, this might mean nations may announce
          beforehand what their plans are for a war, so that people can participate in a way that is of interest of
          their character. This does not, however, excuse metagaming, where information that the character does not know
          is used in character.

        <h3>Agency</h3>
        <p>
          Agency is the importance of players to tell a story without staff intervention. It also means the ability for
          players to regulate their own internal community. In addition, it concerns the ability for people to control
          what their own characters do. This does not excuse powergaming, where a character is made out to be more
          powerful than they actually are, going beyond realistic ability. Neither does it free people or their
          characters from consequences: actions that are taken will be remembered by others, and may influence how they
          interact with you or your character.
