Welcome, and thank you for showing interest in playing on Loretale! We're a whitelisted server, which means you'll need to write an application to be able to join. Fear not, submitting an application is really easy, and shouldn't take more than a minute or two!

First, you should join [our discord](https://discord.gg/FrKGmZf83V). In this discord, you should be able to find the `#applications` channel. If you can't, ask in `#general` or make a ticket in `#tickets`.

In the applications channel, there will be a message with a button which says apply. If you click this button, you will start your application and be given a small questionaire.

## Hytale Username

You'll be asked to fill in your hytale username. We need this so we can actually whitelist you! If you happen to make a typo, please mention it in the thread that is created for your application after you're done filling out the form, or make a ticket in `#tickets`.

## Are you 16 or older?

While we try to welcome everyone, we set a minimum age at 16 for the server. Know that if you're not at least 16 years old, your application will be denied.

## Define Metagaming & Powergaming

Metagaming and powergaming are two concepts that come up often in disputes about roleplay, so we'd like to make sure you know them well. Because of this, we want you to write one or two sentences explaining what the concepts are. If you're not sure, google is your friend. You can also check out our [Roleplay Rules]({{ '/rules/roleplay-rules/' | relative_url }}).

## Describe Your Character

To play on the server, you'll have to come up with a character. Because of this, we'd like for you to describe a character in short. Give them a name, tell us where they came from, etcetera. For reference, you can always look at our [lore]({{ '/lore/' | relative_url }}). Do keep in mind that characters which do not follow our lore will not be accepted. Don't worry about this too much! When you're accepted, you're free to make new characters and dispose of old ones freely.

## Respond to the Prompt in Character

In this section, you're given a prompt. We'd like for you to respond to the prompt as if you're playing on the server. This doesn't need to be lengthy at all, we just like to see what you come up with! If this doesn't go entirely smoothly, that's okay as well. We'll mention how we generally do things, and then accept your application anyway ;).

Here's a sample response if you're struggling:

> Eric stumbled off the ship, his eyes scanning the crowded docks he arrived at. He was skinny, the months at sea hadn't treated him well. And this new land, it was overwhelming. So much he had almost not noticed the man speaking to him. "It was..." the boy stammered, "We thought we were dead."

## After That

A thread will be created for you! In this thread, you can add additional details if you have any. We might also ask some questions if something is unclear to us. When we've reviewed your application, we'll put it on one of three statuses:

1. Denied - You're not accepted to the server. For now, anyway. You can just apply again, but something went so wrong we think it's best for you to start over completely. This doesn't happen often.
2. Pending - We understood most of what you wrote down, but we have a question or two that we'd like you to clarify. Generally, after answering these questions, you'll be put on the third status (if you didn't get there immediately).
3. Accepted - You've been accepted to the server. You can start playing immediately! Welcome, we're happy to have you!
