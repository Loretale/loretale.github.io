Roleplay means immersion yourself into a character, and, in the case of our server, writing out actions and dialogue for them. To do this, we have a number of plugins that aid in the process. The main one of these is RPEngine, it handles character creation and the local chat.

When in game, you can do `/character` to open the character menu. Here, you can see the characters available to you, and you're able to create, edit, and switch to other characters.

Now you've created a character, you can send chat messages as them. We have several chat channels to aid with this:

1. #w (#wooc). Whisper, with a 2 block range.
2. #q (#qooc). Quiet speaking, with an 8 block range.
3. #rp (#looc). Roleplay chat, with a 20 block range.
4. #s (#sooc). Shout chat, with a 40 block range.
5. #global. The global out of character chat.

A message can be sent in any of these channels by prepending the message with the corresponding `#channel`. For example `#rp "Hello."` will send `Character Name: Hello` into the local roleplay channel. The channels in brackets are the corresponding out of character channels, with the same range.

To focus on a channel simply send the `#channel` on its own. For example, sending `#q` will send all subsequent messaged into the quiet local roleplay chat.

Sometimes you might want to start with an action instead of dialogue. There are two ways to do this:

1. Start your message with a single star; `*`. This will include the name of your character into the subsequent action. For example, `* stands up` will turn into `Character Name stands up`.
2. Start your message with two stars; `**`. This will leave out the name of the character entirely, and instead start with `[!]`. This can also be used to describe environmental pieces, for example, `** The branch fell off the tree.` turns into `[!] The branch fell off the tree.`.
